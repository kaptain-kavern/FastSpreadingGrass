# FastSpreadingGrass

Makes grass able to spread seeds quicker. They now can emits seeds after 1 day instead of 3 days normally.

Same goes for tall grass but the change are 2 days instead of 3 days in vanilla.

In the end, it makes grass regrowing quicker after fires or winter; *you know for those time where the whole map seems deprived of any grass ...*

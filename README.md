# FastSpreadingGrass
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaptain-kavern/FastSpreadingGrass/master/About/Preview.png" alt="Preview"/></p>
Makes grass able to spread seeds quicker. They now can emit seeds after 1 day instead of 3 days normally.

In the end, it makes grass regrowing quicker after fires or winter; *you know for those time where the whole map seems deprived of any grass ...*
